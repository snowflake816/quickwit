## Reporting a Vulnerability

To disclose a vulnerability in our code, please notify us by email at security@quickwit.io or private message _@fulmicoton_ or _@guilload_ on our Discord 
server ([discord.quickwit.io](https://discord.quickwit.io)). We will open a draft security advisory on our repository and grant you access so you can
share with us more details about the vulnerability. After releasing a fix, we will publish the security advisory to publicly disclose the security vulnerability
to the project's community.
