//! This crate contains all of the building pieces that make quickwit's IO possible.
//!
//! - The `StorageDirectory` justs wraps a `Storage` trait to make it compatible with tantivy's
//!   Directory API.
//! - The `HotDirectory` wraps another directory with a static cache.
//! - The `CachingDirectory` wraps a Directory with a dynamic cache.
//! - The `DebugDirectory` acts as a proxy to another directory to instrument it and record all of
//!   its IO.
