Quickwit is built from the ground up to [efficiently index unstructured data](../guides/schemaless.md), and search it effortlessly on cloud storage.
Moreover, Quickwit supports OpenTelemetry gRPC and HTTP (protobuf only) protocols out of the box and provides a REST API ready to ingest any JSON formatted logs.
**This makes Quickwit a perfect fit for logs!**.
