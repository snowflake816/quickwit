## Quickwit v0.1 limitations

Quickwit v0.1 comes with the following limitations:

- no support for file formats other than [NDJSON](http://ndjson.org/);
- no support for object storages not compatible with Amazon S3;
- no aggregations nor faceted search;
- no deletions (append mode only). One can only delete splits;
- no split merging;
- no indexing server;
- no concurrent indexing on the same index, as the object storage metastore would not allow it.
