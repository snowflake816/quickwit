title: Tracing with Jaeger

In this quick start guide, we will set up a Quickwit instance and analyze its own traces with Jaeger using Docker Compose.

You only need a minute to get Jaeger working with Quickwit storage backend.

## Start Quickwit and Jaeger

Let's use `docker compose` with the following configuration:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
version: "3"

services:
  quickwit:
    image: quickwit/quickwit:${QW_VERSION:-0.7.0}
    volumes:
      - ./qwdata:/quickwit/qwdata
    ports:
      - 7280:7280
    environment:
      - QW_ENABLE_OPENTELEMETRY_OTLP_EXPORTER=true
      - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:7281
    command: ["run"]

  jaeger-query:
    image: jaegertracing/jaeger-query:1.52
    ports:
      - 16686:16686
    environment:
      - SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=grpc-plugin
      - GRPC_STORAGE_SERVER=quickwit:7281
      - GRPC_STORAGE_TLS=false
```

As you can see in the docker compose file, Quickwit is configured to send its own traces `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to itself `http://localhost:7281`.
On the other side, Jaeger is configured to use a gRPC storage server `quickwit:7281`.

Save and run the recipe:

```bash
$ docker compose up
```

You should be able to access Quickwit's UI on `http://localhost:7280/` and Jager's UI on `http://localhost:16686/`.


## Searching and view traces in Jaeger

Quickwit generates many traces, let's take a look at some of them:
- `find_traces`: generated by the "Find traces" Jaeger button.
- `get_operations`: generated by Jaeger when it is fetching the list of operations.
- `get_services`: generated by Jaeger when it is fetching the list of services.
- `ingest-spans`: generated when Quickwit receives spans on the gRPC OTLP API.
- ...

Here are the screenshots of the search and trace view:

## Searching traces with Quickwit UI

You can also use the Quickwit UI at [http://localhost:7280](http://localhost:7280) to search traces.

Here are a couple of query examples:
- `service_name:quickwit AND events.event_attributes.level:INFO`
- `span_duration_millis:>100`
- `resource_attributes.service.version:v0.7.0`
- `service_name:quickwit`

That's it! You can level up with the following tutorials to discover all Quickwit features.
