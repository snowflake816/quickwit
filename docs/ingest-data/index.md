import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />

It is possible to ingest data with log shippers like [OpenTelemetry](../log-management/index.md#opentelemetry-agent), [Fluentbit](../log-management/send-logs-from-fluentbit-to-quickwit.md), or [Vector](../log-management/send-logs-from-vector-to-quickwit.md). It's also possible to send traces from your apps to the [OpenTelemetry Collector](../log-management/deploy-quickwit-otel-with-helm.md) and then to Quickwit.
