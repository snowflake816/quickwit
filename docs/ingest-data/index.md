<DocCardList />

It is possible to ingest data with log shippers like [OpenTelemetry](../log-management/overview.md#opentelemetry-agent), [Fluentbit](../log-management/send-logs/using-fluentbit.md), or [Vector](../log-management/send-logs/using-vector.md). It's also possible to send traces from your apps to the [OpenTelemetry Collector](../log-management/send-logs/using-otel-collector-with-helm.md) and then to Quickwit.
