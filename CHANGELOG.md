More details in tantivy's [changelog](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

### Changed

- Improve OTEL traces index config (#4311)
  - OTEL endpoints are now using by default indexes `otel-logs-v0_7` and `otel-traces-v0_7` instead of `otel-logs-v0_6` and `otel-traces-v0_6`
  - OTEL indexes have more fields stored as "fast" and have Trace and Span ID bytes field in hex format

- Increased the gRPC payload limits from 10MiB to 20MiB (#4227)
- Reject malformed Elasticsearch API requests (#4175)
- Better logging when doc processing fails (#4323)
- Search performance improvements
- Indexing performance improvements

### Removed

### Migration from 0.6.x to 0.7

The format of the index and internal objects stored in the metastore of 0.7 is backward compatible with 0.6.

If you are using the OTEL indexes and ingesting data into indexes the `otel-logs-v0_6` and `otel-traces-v0_6`, you must stop indexing before upgrading.
Indeed, the first time you start Quickwit 0.7, it will update the doc mapping fields of Trace ID and Span ID of those two indexes by changing their input/output formats from base64 to hex. This is automatic: you don't have to perform any manual operation.
Quickwit 0.7 will create new indexes `otel-logs-v0_7` and `otel-traces-v0_7`, which are now used by default when ingesting data with the OTEL gRPC and HTTP API. The Jaeger gRPC and HTTP APIs will query both `otel-traces-v0_6` and `otel-traces-v0_7` by default.
It's possible to define the index ID you want to use for OTEL gRPC endpoints and Jaeger gRPC API by setting the request header `qw-otel-logs-index` or `qw-otel-traces-index` to the index ID you want to target.


## [0.6.1]

### Added
- Support of phrase prefix queries in the query language.

### Fixed
- Fix timestamp field which was not allowed when defined in an object mapping.
- Fix querying of integer on a JSON field (no document were returned).


## [0.6.0] - 2023-06-03

### Added
- Elasticsearch/Opensearch compatible API.
- New columnar format:
    - Fast fields can now have any cardinality (Optional, Multivalued, restricted). In fact cardinality is now only used to format the output.
    - Dynamic Fields are now fast fields.
- String fast fields now can be normalized.
- Various parameters of object storages can now be configured.
- The ingest API makes it possible to force a commit, or wait for a scheduled commit to occur.
- Ability to parse non-JSON data using VRL to extract some structure from documents.
- Object storage can now use the `virtual-hostedâ€“style`.
- `date_histogram` aggregation.
- `percentiles` aggregation.
- Added support for Prefix Phrase query.
- Added support for range queries.
- The query language now supports different date formats.
- Added support for base16 input/output configuration for bytes field. You can search for bytes fields using base16 encoded values.
- Autotagging: fields used in the partition key are automatically added to tags.
- Added arm64 docker image.
- Added CORS configuration for the REST API.


### Fixed
- Major bug fix that required to restart quickwit when deleting and recreating an index with the same name.
- The number of concurrent GET requests to object stores is now limited. This fixes a bug observed with when requested a lot of documents from MinIO.
- Quickwit now searches into resource attributes when receiving a Jaeger request carrying tags
- Object storage can be figured to:
    - avoid Bulk delete API (workaround for Google Cloud Storage).
    - Use virtual-host style addresses (workaround for Alibaba Object Storage Service).
- Fix aggregation min doc_count empty merge bug.
- Fix: Sort order for term aggregations.
- Switch to ms in histogram for date type (aligning with ES).

### Improvements

- Search performance improvement.
- Aggregation performance improvement.
- Aggregation memory improvement.

More details in tantivy's [changelog](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

### Changed
- Datetime now have up to a nanosecond precision.
- By default, quickwit now uses the node's hostname as the default node ID.
- By default, Quickwit is in dynamic mode and all dynamic fields are marked as fast fields.
- JSON field uses by default the raw tokanizer and is set to fast field.
- Various performance/compression improvements.
- OTEL indexes Trace ID and Span ID are now bytes fields.
- OTEL indexes stores timestamps with nanosecond precision.
- pan status is now indexed in the OTEL trace index.
- Default and raw tokenizers filter tokesn longer than 255 bytes instead of 40 bytes.
