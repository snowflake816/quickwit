|--------------------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Your documents are immutable: application logs, system logs, access logs, user actions logs, audit trail  (logs), etc.                    	| Your documents are mutable.   	|
| Your data has a time component. Quickwit includes optimizations and design choices specifically related to time. | You need a low-latency search for e-commerce websites.               	|
| You want a full-text search in a multi-tenant environment.     	| You provide a public-facing search with high QPS.	|
| You want to index directly from Kafka / Kinesis. | You want to re-score documents at query time.
| You want to add full-text search to your ClickHouse cluster.
| You ingest a tremendous amount of logs and don't want to pay huge bills.                                                             	|
| You ingest a tremendous amount of data and you don't want to waste your precious time babysitting your cluster.

# ‚ö° Getting Started

Quickwit compiles to a single binary and we provide [various ways to install it](https://quickwit.io/docs/get-started/installation). The easiest is to run the command below from your preferred shell:

```markdown
curl -L https://install.quickwit.io | sh
```

You can now move this executable directory wherever sensible for your environment and possibly add it to your¬†`PATH`¬†environment.

# üôã FAQ

### How can I switch from Elasticsearch to Quickwit?

In Quickwit 0.3, we released Elasticsearch compatible Ingest-API, so that you can change the configuration of your current log shipper (Vector, Fluent Bit, Syslog, ...) to send data to Quickwit. You can query the logs using the Quickwit Web UI or [Search API](https://quickwit.io/docs/reference/rest-api). We also support [ES compatible Aggregation-API](https://quickwit.io/docs/reference/aggregation).

### How is Quickwit different from traditional search engines like Elasticsearch or Solr?

The core difference and advantage of Quickwit is its architecture that is built from the ground up for cloud and log management. Optimized IO paths make search on object storage sub-second and thanks to the true decoupled compute and storage, search instances are stateless, it is possible to add or remove search nodes within seconds. Last but not least, we implemented a highly-reliable distributed search and exactly-once semantics during indexing so that all engineers can sleep at night. All this slashes costs for log management.

### How does Quickwit compare to Elastic in terms of cost?

We estimate that Quickwit can be up to 10x cheaper on average than Elastic. To understand how, check out our [blog post about searching the web on AWS S3](https://quickwit.io/blog/commoncrawl/).

### What license does Quickwit use?

Quickwit is open-source under the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 - AGPLv3. Fundamentally, this means that you are free to use Quickwit for your project, as long as you don't modify Quickwit. If you do, you have to make the modifications public.
We also provide a commercial license for enterprises to provide support and a voice on our roadmap.

### Is it possible to setup Quickwit for a High Availability (HA)?

Not today, but HA is on our roadmap.

### What is Quickwit's business model?

Our business model relies on our commercial license. There is no plan to become SaaS in the near future.
