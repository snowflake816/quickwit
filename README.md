# üôã FAQ

### How can I switch from Elasticsearch to Quickwit?

Quickwit has an Elasticsearch-compatible Ingest-API to make it easier to migrate your log shippers (Vector, Fluent Bit, Syslog, ...) to Quickwit. However, we only support [ES aggregation DSL](https://quickwit.io/docs/reference/aggregation), the query DSL support is planned for Q2 2023.

### How is Quickwit different from traditional search engines like Elasticsearch or Solr?

The core difference and advantage of Quickwit are its architecture built from the ground to search on cloud storage. We optimized IO paths, revamped the index data structures and made search stateless and sub-second on cloud storage.

### How does Quickwit compare to Elastic in terms of cost?

We estimate that Quickwit can be up to 10x cheaper on average than Elastic. To understand how, check out our [blog post](https://quickwit.io/blog/commoncrawl/) about searching the web on AWS S3.

### What license does Quickwit use?

Quickwit is open-source under the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 - AGPLv3. Fundamentally, this means you are free to use Quickwit for your project if you don't modify Quickwit. However, if you do and you are distributing your modified version to the public, you have to make the modifications public.
We also provide a commercial license for enterprises to provide support and a voice on our roadmap.

### Is it possible to setup Quickwit for a High Availability (HA)?

HA is available for search, for indexing it's available only with a Kafka source. 

### What is Quickwit's business model?

Our business model relies on our commercial license. There is no plan to become SaaS soon.
